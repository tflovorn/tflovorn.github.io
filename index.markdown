Utilities
==========

[Cuhre.jl](https://github.com/tflovorn/Cuhre.jl):
---------
A Julia wrapper for the adaptive integration routine Cuhre, which provides efficient integration of vector-valued integrands over multidimensional domains.

[cmatrix](https://github.com/tflovorn/cmatrix):
---------
Provides a representation of a complex-valued matrix in Go which respects the Matrix interface of gonum. Also provides a wrapper to the eigendecomposition routine for a Hermitian matrix provided by the GNU Scientific Library.

Computational Physics Projects
===============================

[scExplorer](https://github.com/tflovorn/scExplorer):
---------
Developed for my dissertation project; implemented in Go with C and Python wrappers. Solves the self-consistent equations associated with a new model of cuprate high-temperature superconductors. These solutions are used to calculate observable quantities including superconducting critical temperature, specific heat, and diamagnetic response.

[tiKit](https://github.com/tflovorn/tiKit):
---------
A collection of resources for modeling topological insulators. Contains Python implementations of minimal model Hamiltonians. Also contains density functional theory input files, tools for generating these input files, and tools for analyzing the results.

[scsbz](https://github.com/tflovorn/scsbz):
-------
Solves the self-consistent equations associated with a slave-boson model of cuprate superconductors. Implemented in Fortran.

[vo2percolation](https://github.com/tflovorn/vo2percolation):
-------
Monte Carlo analysis of clusters in a percolation model of the metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide. Written in Go with C wrappers; currently incomplete.

Other Projects
==============

[coffeetree](https://github.com/tflovorn/coffeetree):
---------
CoffeeScript/HTML5 implementation of the [Pythagoras tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras_tree_%28fractal%29) fractal.

[processing-tower-defense](https://github.com/tflovorn/processing-tower-defense):
--------
Adds real-time multiplayer to an existing JavaScript/Processing single-player tower defense game.

[zombux](https://github.com/tflovorn/zombux) and [Zombies](https://github.com/tflovorn/Zombies):
--------
Collaborative projects in JavaScript/HTML5 rendering and input. Tiny games with distinct control mechanics for zombie-shooting.

[profiteer](https://github.com/tflovorn/profiteer):
--------
Python program to extract data from the SQL database of EVE Online items to calculate expected prices.
